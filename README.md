The given house_price.csv contains property prices in the city of Bangalore. I examined the price per square feet did the following: 
Performed basic EDA which includes acquring the data,importing all the necessary libraries like pandas,numPy,matplotlib.pyplot,seaborn etc.
Detected the outliers using following methods and remove it using methods like trimming / capping/ imputation using mean or median  
a) Mean and Standard deviation
b)Percentile method 
c) IQR(Inter quartile range method)
d) Z Score method
Created a box plot and used this to determine which method seems to work best to remove outliers for this data.
A histplotis created  to check the normality of the column(price per sqft column) and performed transformations if needed.
Checkedthe skewness and kurtosis before and after the transformation.
Checked the correlation between all the numerical columns and plot heatmap.  
Scatter plots are created between the variables to check the correlation between them.
